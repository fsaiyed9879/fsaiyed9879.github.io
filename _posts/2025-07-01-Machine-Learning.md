**Learning Outcomes for the Machine Learning Unit:**

    1- Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.
    2- Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.
    3- Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.
    4- Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

**Unit 1**
Machine Learning is truly everywhere these days, driving decisions from our online browsing to big financial choices, all thanks to the explosion of real-time data that helps these systems learn and get smarter day by day, while also increating ethical issues and spread of misinformation (Schwab, 2016). This past 12 weeks, I have really delved deep into the world od ML, tracing its journey from foundational ideas (Bishop, 2006) and core statistical principles (Crawford, 2006) right up to the cutting-edge applications like deep learning in social computing (Zhao & Li, 2018). What really struck me is both the exciting oppornity ML brings to the data world but also the serious challenges that come with relying on such algorithms. I explored how big data, ML, and AI all fit together in today's vast data landscape. Now, i have a much clearer picture of ML's huge potential to reshape industries (Metcalf; 2024; WEF; 2025), the specific skills needed to master this field and crucially the ethical pitfalls we must discuss (BBC News, 2020).

**Unit 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis**
This unit introduced me with EDA practically, where I performed data analysis on the Auto-MPD dataset provided online in a csv format. I uploaded this data into google colab to identify data completeness and estimate skewness & kurtosis. I plotted a bunch of visuals to present back results of my EDA. It proved a great strating point especially given the simplicity of the dataset I was using, allowing me experiment.
